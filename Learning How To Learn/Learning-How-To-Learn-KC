What they learned about themselve?

% Although I knew I wasm primarily a visual learner, I was surprised to learn I am 40% of a auditory learner as well. 
% This makes sense becuase when I learn I tend to speak aloud or ask myself questions when learning new topics. 
% I also, tend to get frustrated when others talk too much when I am focused. It's odd because I can listen to lofi music and be fine. 
% However, the minute someone tries tom have a conversation with me, it tends to be a huge distraction.

% What from this lesson they felt challenged by?

% I was not overly challenged by much in the lesson. I took Barbra Oakley's course on coursera. I also teach growth mindset to my students and it is somethng that incorporate in my daily life. I think I'd just need help being accountable with getting the spaced repitition in and coding challenges done daily.

% What from this lesson they want to practice?

% Alot of the techniques in the video was coverd by Barbra Oakley's course Learning to Learn on Coursera, so I've been using these techniques since January and the leaps in learning I've had has been astronomical. I would like to be more consitant with my anki cards so tht I do not forgert the information learned. I do tend to forget information rather quickly so, I absolutely have to do these reviews daily. Anki or remnotes is a good tool to use. Another thing I would like to be more consistant with is doing coding challenges daily. I can genrally solve the challenges that are easy but not on the first try. I'd press the run button and would have simple errors like typos. I now know from this lesson that the best way to get better at these things is to get hands on keyboard time.
